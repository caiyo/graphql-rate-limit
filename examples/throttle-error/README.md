# GraphQL Rate Limit - Error from Throttle

This example illustrates a custom error raised on rate limit exceeded.

## Overview

Specify a `throttle` function. Throws a `RateLimitError` with contextual information.

## Setup

#### Step 1: Install requirements

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

#### Step 1: Start server

```bash
node index.js
```

#### Step 2: Open Playground

Navigate to [`http://localhost:4000/`](http://localhost:4000/) in a browser.

#### Step 3: Execute GraphQL operations

Server is configured to allow each field to be queried once every 15 seconds.

Sample query:

```graphql
{
  quote
  books {
    title
  }
}
```
