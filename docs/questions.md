# Questions

- How can multiple resolvers count against the same rate or be separated?
- How to specify the rate(s) that are allowable per period of time (100/day or 3/hour)
- How to define limits per segregation (ip/user/application)?
- How can a mutation that has a user error(s) not be counted ("skip failed requests")?
- How to inform clients about limits (over, under, remaining, when resets)?
